# gwt-datawindow
Generate DataWindow Controller by GWT tools.

gwt-datawindow is a project writen using GWT, it read datawindow's defination from database.
The Datawindow Defination String is generated by PowerBuilder7.0 and save it as a text string, then copy it to database.

The GWT-DataWindow then read it from database, and analyse its symbol and convert it to a inner VO object.
Then GWT-DataWindow will draw on this VO object to an DOM object, at run time, the GWT then convert it to js and dom object.

so that you can using PowerBuilder's datawindow object in GWT directly.

Other function will be added at next time.

Any Question, contract me.
